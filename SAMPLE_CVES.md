```

### Example 3: Research Assistant with Minor Issue
**Name:** David Lee  
**Role:** Research Assistant at University Lab  
**Problem:**
```
I found some unusual files on our shared research drive. Should I be worried about a potential breach? The files appeared suddenly and I don't recognize them.
```

### Example 4: IT Support with General Question
**Name:** Jennifer Brown  
**Role:** IT Support at Biotech Startup  
**Problem:**
```
I'm not sure if this is a security issue, but our computers have been running slow lately. There are some pop-ups appearing and I'm concerned about malware.
```

### Example 5: Student with Non-Security Issue
**Name:** Chris Anderson  
**Role:** Undergraduate Student  
**Problem:**
```
I'm having trouble accessing some files on the research server. Not sure if this is a security problem or just a technical issue. Can someone help?
```
